# GANg

### Running

For running the `main.ipynb` file is used.
Different models can be used by commenting the current out and uncommenting the desired one.


### Trained classifier
For score calculations a trained classifier for each dataset is required.
Here we provide the classifiers for the MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset: https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/589691db916542a2bb07/

The vgg model is from https://github.com/huyvnphan/PyTorch_CIFAR10

The models should be located in the folder called `classifier` next the scripts for loading them.
